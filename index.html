                The Colorado Animal Rescue (abbreviated C.A.R.E) is a non-profit organization located in the Colorado Rocky Mountain
                city of Glenwood Springs. Since it’s conception in 1992, the Colorado Animal Rescue has found homes for over 20,000
                abandoned, stray, and surrendured animals under the core values of Socially Conscious Sheltering.
            </p>
            <p>
                This redesign presents an approach help the Colorado Animal Rescue meet the rising demand of animals in need by
                augmenting the adoption process to better retain users and ensure that quality adoptions are made to maintain animals in
                homes rather than in shelters.

                    To better understand our users, our stakeholders, and our competitors, I collaborated with two other UX designers to
                    gather research. To learn more about the landscape of colorado animal adoption shelters. We conducted a Competitor
                    analysis to better understand how CARE compares to other shelters in the Rocky Mountain Region.

                        My competitive analysis revealed to me that the small size of the Colorado Animal Resue may serve as a competitive advantage. Due to its smaller size, C.A.R.E employees are able to spend more quality time with their animals. Because of this, CARE is able to give more time to get to know their animals. One of the ways they do this is through using the ASPCA Pet Personality Assessment on all their dogs and cats to identify what type of home they would best belong in.

                From the survey results, I learned that for potential adopters post-covid, 80% of our users were making decisions
                about where to adopt from based on information provided online. This ultimately means that the website is the first
                point of contact in the adoption process where we have a responsibility to lay a positive foundation to encourage
                users to continue with their adoption at C.A.R.E. Also, based on data gathered from both the survey and the
                interviews, we learned that the number 1 pain point experienced by users was a lack of information on adoption pages
                to guide the user through the adoption process. However, the second leading painpoint was an overwhelming amount of
                information during adoption that confuses and overloads the user. This overall demonstrates a need to balance the
                information architecture to help our users better filter what content pertains to them.

                <h2>Usability testing insights</h2>
                <p>
                    Before imagining the design solution, we wanted to first understand the problem thoroughly from a multifaceted
                    perspective. We started by gathering data about the usability of the current Colorado Animal Rescue Site to uncover
                    areas where we may be losing users along the adoption process currently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My colleagues assisted me in conducting 5 usability tests in which we instructed users to navigate the site as a
                    potential adopter. These tests were conducted remotely using zoom with an open ended, think-aloud format. From these
                    tests we were able to organize key insights into an affinity diagram and a priority matrix to illuminate areas of
                    improvement to focus the designs.

            Through my research, the Colorado Animal Rescue was the only shelter in the area that was already using the ASPCA
            guide
            to pet personalities to assess their animals, largely due to their small size allowing them more quality time per
            animal. I felt as though utilizing this strength by restructuring the online adoption process to center around a pet
            personality quiz would be a unique way to create sustainable adoption pairs while also gamifying the adoption
            process
            and removing some of the overwhelm of adopting by introducing the user's to their best lifestyle matches right away.

        <p class="additional-text">
            Alongside this, I established plans to better communicate the adoption process, step-by-step, from start to finish.
            This
            includes rebranding the adoption process using terms and language that users can better understand and disclosing
            important information such as the appointment only policy up front. Lastly, I made plans to augment the website's
            current information architecture to define a clear hierarchy that intuitively guides the user to a call to action.

                        Maintaining a consistent throughline of empathy is important to always keep the product grounded by user needs. Thus, I collaborated with my team members again to develop a storyboard and UX scenario to imagine how my proposed solution might play out for a user like Amanda. The goal was to see our solution through the lens of our users and empathize with the the thoughts, feelings and emotions they may be experiencing along the way.

                        In order to create a functional quiz that could produce results that align with real ASPCA Pet Personality Archetypes, I needed to conduct extensive research on the components of pet personalities so that I could design questions that strategically match a person's lifestyle to the ASPCA archetype that is a good match. For the purposes of the prototype, I focused solely on the Dog personaliy guide. The ASPCA defines their "Canine-alities" by measuring two key attributes of a dog's personality: Persistence and Motivation. Each permutation of these characteristic variations produce one of the nine total dog personalities.

                    Persistence refers to the level of mental or physical activity a dog needs to have in order to feel satisfied
                    and is
                    measured from mild, to moderate, to high persistence.

                <p class="flex-text2">
                    Motivation refers to what sorts of rewards a dog values most. The three types of motivation styles are internal,
                    external, and social motivation.

                        Understanding these two metrics allowed me to strategically design quiz questions that could compare each characteristic
                        to particular lifestyle choices of the user. Each question assessed either motivation or persistence independently, with multiple choice answers that would determine which of the three variations of the trait each user would best align with. Below are some sample questions.
